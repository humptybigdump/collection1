\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{List of Abbreviations}

Abbreviations are to be used sparingly and must be explained in the text before they are used for the first time. The abbreviation is inserted in brackets after the full wording. After that, it should be used consistently and should not switch between the full wording and the abbreviation in the continuous text, as this will confuse the reader. Abbreviations that are also listed in Duden can be used without further explanation. Metric and non-metric units of measurement such as cm, kg, or min are also common and can, therefore, be used without explanation. All other abbreviations must appear in full in the list of abbreviations, e.g.:
